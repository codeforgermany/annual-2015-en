            The city of Munich has been publishing its data on its online council information system (CIS) for years now. While that is commendable, the CIS sadly lacks practical usability. That's why the OK Lab Munich developed a <a href="https://www.muenchen-transparent.de/">Transparency Portal</a> earlier this year which makes data from the CIS more accessible. The site is useful for searching through official documents, and also offers a wide range of applications that promote civic participation. For example, one can subscribe via email to certain petitions, get to know local politicians on social media, and keep an eye on important sessions in the parliament. The site has become a popular transparency platform in Munich.</p>
