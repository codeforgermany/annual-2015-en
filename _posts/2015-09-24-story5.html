            <p>Despite efforts of environmental organizations, the European limit for atmospheric particulates is regularly exceeded in Stuttgart. To tackle the problem, the OK Lab developed sensors that collect particulate matter data at several locations around the city. Self-made devices measure air quality and automatically upload it over the internet. This results in more diversity and transparency in data collection. The project is not only a great example of citizen science, but also draws attention to the environmental and health problems in the city. At <a href="http://luftdaten.info/">Luftdaten.info</a> you can now support the continued production and monitoring by donation.</p>
