            <p>This year also marks the start of a new partnership. "Jugend hackt" is another project of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany which supports young programmers. With the help of mentors from our network, teens are introduced, step by step, into the world of open data and civic technology. In June, Jugend hackt and Hack Your City have jointly organized a hackathon in Dresden. <a href="https://hackdash.org/dashboards/jhost2015">Projects</a> such as wifi trees, smart dustbins and a new barter platform could all be part of the city of the future. We care about the next generation of civic hackers very much and will certainly continue this collaboration!
