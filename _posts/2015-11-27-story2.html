           <p>Behind every Code for Germany project are people who want to change something, and we'd like to get to know them and their work better. So this year we launched a new column for short portraits from different cities around Germany â€“ because we are not only interested in results. We want to find out what obstacles and challenges the teams faced in their projects, and what we can learn from them. The new "urban stories" are about the joy and pain of coding, bad design, even worse German jargon and (the lack of) machine-readable data. We finally get to know the people who are behind the apps and run the whole show backstage. What problems bothered them? What worked? What didn't? And what motivates them? The column will be expanded during the year.
