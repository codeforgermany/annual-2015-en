            <p>In 2015, the number of people fleeing war and poverty has increased dramatically. This posed new challenges to both politics and civil society in Germany and other countries. Facilitating a smooth arrival and enabling sustainable integration are still the most urgent issues that require diverse resources and expertise to solve. The tech community in Germany has quickly taken to the matter. Within a short time accommodations with <a href="http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2015-09/fluechtlinge-refugees-emancipation-wlan-unterkuenfte-freifunk">free wifi</a> have been made available, and arrival apps were developed specifically for refugees. Many <a href="http://refugeehackathon.de">Refugee Hackathons</a> have been organized in cooperation with refugees to ensure that the applications will in fact be useful for the new neighbors. The OK Labs were involved in the process and participated in the development of numerous applications, not only with Freifunk but also at hackathons in Berlin, Hamburg and Wuppertal. We will no doubt continue our support for the newcomers in 2016.
